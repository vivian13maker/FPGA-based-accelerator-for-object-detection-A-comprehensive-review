# Design and FPGA Implementation of a Pseudo-random Number Generator Based on a HopÔ¨Åeld Neural Network Under Electromagnetic Radiation

## ABSTRACT

When implementing a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) for neural network chaos-based systems on FPGAs, chaotic degradation caused by numerical accuracy constraints can have a dramatic impact on the performance of the PRNG. To suppress this degradation, a PRNG with a feedback controller based on a Hopfield neural network chaotic oscillator is proposed, in which a neuron is exposed to electromagnetic radiation. We choose the
magnetic flux across the cell membrane of the neuron as a feedback condition of the feedback controller to disturb other neurons, thus avoiding periodicity. The proposed PRNG is modeled and simulated on Vivado 2018.3 software and implemented and synthesized by the FPGA device ZYNQ-XC7Z020 on Xilinx using Verilog HDL code. As the basic entropy source, the Hopfield neural network with one neuron exposed to electromagnetic radiation has been implemented on the FPGA using the high precision 32-bit Runge Kutta fourth-order method (RK4) algorithm from the IEEE 754-1985 floating point standard. The post-processing module consists of 32 registers and 15 XOR comparators. The binary data generated by the scheme was tested and analyzed using the NIST 800.22 statistical test suite. The results show that it has high security and randomness. Finally, an image encryption
and decryption system based on PRNG is designed and implemented on FPGA. The feasibility of the system is proved by simulation and security analysis.

## Contribution

In this paper, a PRNG with a feedback controller based on the improved Hopfield chaotic neural network oscillator is proposed and well implemented on FPGA. Among them, the magnetic flux of neurons is taken as the judgment condition, and the feedback controller is used to add the corresponding
interference factor to the neurons with the highest Lyapunov exponent, so as to reduce the influence of chaos degradation on the generated random numbers and improve the randomness of the random sequence. The post-processing unit consists of 32 registers and 15 XOR comparators. From the chip statistics, it can be seen that the PRNG can be implemented on FPGA and the output data rate can be up to 16.2 Mbit/s. The performance
of the PRNG was tested. The security analysis and FPGA implementation of the image encryption and decryption system based on PRNG show that PRNG has good randomness and engineering application value. Existing feedback controllers and post-processing algorithms will be improved in the future to further improve the randomness of the PRNG and reduce the impact of chaotic degradation.
