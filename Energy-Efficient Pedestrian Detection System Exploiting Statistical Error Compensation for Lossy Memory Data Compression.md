# Energy-Efficient Pedestrian Detection System: Exploiting Statistical Error Compensation for Lossy Memory Data Compression
## ABSTRACT

Pedestrian detection represents an important application for embedded vision systems. Focusing on the most energy constrained implementations, systems have typically employed histogram of oriented gradients features and support vector machine classification, which leads to low detection accuracy (a log-average miss rate of 68% on the Caltech Pedestrian dataset). Additionally, single-scale detection is often adopted in these systems for real-time processing, which further deteriorates the detection performance. In this paper, we propose a hardware accelerator achieving substantially higher detection accuracy by employing aggregated channel features (ACFs) at multiple different scales and using boosted decision trees for classification. Though resulting in higher accuracy, the higher dimensionality ACFs exacerbate memory operations, which become the energy and speed bottlenecks of the system. To overcome this, we employ binary discrete cosine transform to perform low-overhead and lossy compression, to efficiently store and access feature data. For restoring performance following compression, we exploit retraining of the classifier, resulting in an optimal model for pedestrian detection. The proposed accelerator is implemented in field-programmable gate array, which can process 40 video graphics array frames (640 × 480 resolution) per second at a log-average miss rate of 42% on the Caltech Pedestrian dataset, with compression reducing memory energy by 4× and overall energy by 1.7×.

## Contribution

1) The concept of statistical error compensation for overcoming feature data errors from compression loss is presented and analyzed for the potential it holds in addressing memory operations. They find that substantial opportunity for compression on feature data opens up, namely three times more with statistical error compensation than without it, in our demonstrated system.

2) An architecture for pedestrian detection is developed whereby the use of lossy compression is exploited toward mitigating expensive memory operations. However, performing compression over a block of feature data necessitates additional buffering, which introduces additional memory overhead besides the compression and decompression operational overheads. In order to minimize the overheads, they perform architectural analysis and employ a hardware-friendly compression approach. Ultimately, the demonstrated architecture achieves four times reduction in memory energy.

3) Their proposed memory compression architecture is implemented using field-programmable gate array (FPGA). For improving detection accuracy, we use boosted decision trees on high-dimensional aggregated channel features (ACFs). Furthermore, multiscale detection is supported to increase accuracy, and the computations involved are accelerated using the method of feature pyramid approximation. The system can run at 40 video graphics array (VGA) frames per second (fps) and achieves high detection accuracy (a logaverage miss rate of 42%) on the Caltech Pedestrian dataset. Compared to a baseline system without feature compression, the log-average miss rate is increased by just 1%, thanks to statistical error compensation. The 4× memory energy reduction by feature data compression yields 1.7 × overall energy reduction for the system.
